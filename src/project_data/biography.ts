Despite this tremendous success, the Oracle of Omaha doesn't feel entitled to the $89 billion net worth his abilities have earned him. Instead, he likes to say that he was born at the right place and time, and as an active philanthropist, he has already pledged to give most of his money to charity. This modesty in the face of proven talent is part of what makes Buffett as popular on Main Street as he is on Wall Street--he is one of the world's wealthiest men and yet he is still personable and relatable."

Larson tells the stories of two men: Daniel H. Burnham, the architect responsible for the fair's construction, and H.H. Holmes, a serial killer masquerading as a charming doctor. Burnham's challenge was immense. In a short period of time, he was forced to overcome the death of his partner and numerous other obstacles to construct the famous \"White City\" around which the fair was built. His efforts to complete the project, and the fair's incredible success, are skillfully related along with entertaining appearances by such notables as Buffalo Bill Cody, Susan B. Anthony, and Thomas Edison."

In the Dam Square in Amsterdam, long-haired young people wearing vibrant clothes and burning incense could be found meditating, playing music and discussing sexual liberation, the expansion of consciousness and the search for an inner truth. They were a generation refusing to live the robotic and unquestioning life that their parents had known."

As a boy he worked several jobs like delivering groceries and working in a shoe repair shop to make ends meet.

He was chosen to compete in the Summer Olympics in Nazi Germany where Adolf Hitler was promoting the idea of “Aryan superiority.” Owens’s winning streak at the games humiliated Hitler and crushed the myth of racial supremacy once and for all."
